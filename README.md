# CryptoQUBO

## Description
CryptoQUBO is a Python script that validates QUBO instances generated for cryptography constructions including AES-128/192/256 and MD5, SHA1 and SHA-256 hash functions. These examples leverage the state-of-the-art encoding techniques of arXiv:??? to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness by having both a small QUBO size and low coefficient magnitudes.


The AES instances encode the e=mc^2!!!!!!!!! message with am encryption/decryption key shown in the first line of the individual example QUBO instances.
In the case of hash function instances the 6-digit password was "e=mc^2" in all examples and the original messages are shown in the first line of the example QUBO files.

## Features
- Empirical proof certificates of XOR and range QUBO encoding formulae
- Example QUBOs of AES-128/192/256, MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 cryptographic algorithms.
- Utilization of QUBO for optimization problems.
- Potential for integration with quantum computing frameworks with .qubo files.
