# CryptoQUBO

## Description
CryptoQUBO is a Python script that demonstrates encoding and potential for solving cryptographic problems using Quantum Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). This project leverages state-of-the-art encoding techniques to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness by having both a small QUBO size and low coefficient magnitudes.

## Features
- Empirical proof certificates of XOR and range QUBO encoding formulae
- Example QUBOs of AES-128/192/256, MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 cryptographic algorithms.
- Utilization of QUBO for optimization problems.
- Potential for integration with quantum computing frameworks with .qubo files.

## Installation
All that is necessary is to clone this repository.

## Usage

To use the CryptoQUBO project, you can run the main script as follows:

```python logic_crypto.py```
